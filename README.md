## What is this?

This repo contains code snippets, try-outs, notes and sketches I made while reading and studying **Advanced React** by **Nadia Makarevich**.

I highly recommend this book!

For each chapter of the book there will be a branch.

1. intro-to-re-renders
2. elements-children-as-props-and-re-renders
